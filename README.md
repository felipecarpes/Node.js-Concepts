# Node.js-Concepts

- Concepts:
In this small application we use the CRUD concepts in Node.js.
Where we can create, list, edit, delete projects and even create new tasks.

- Tools:
We use express.js, which is a web application framework and API for node.js.

- Structure:
It is a small route structure for each request and middleware that checks if the required route exists and how many times it has been requested.

 - This is a small demonstration of the power Javascript has with the tools in the backend.
